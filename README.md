# web_app

The Lane Breach web app allows users to report bicycle lane blockages to San Francisco's 311 service.

The existing 311 mobile app already offers this functionality, but it's clunky and not intuitive.
This app offers a streamlined experience and also provides users with a visualization of bike infrastructure
and lane blockages reported by all users city-wide, as well as a summary of all incidents reported by the current user.

## Getting Started

To build this app, you'll need a computer with Node.js installed. This app was built using node version `v11.13.0` and yarn version `1.15.2`. Submissions will require either a `.env.production` or `.env.development` file with the Lane Breach 311 API key.

Run `yarn` and `yarn develop` to run the project in development mode.
